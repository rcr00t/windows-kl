# Windows Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger written in **C for Windows**. It's part of my **GitHub Portfolio** to show my projects and hopefully inspire others. 

I don't take any responsibility for the **unethical** use of this tool.

This tool is purely educational and intended **only for learning and research purposes**. It is provided as-is, with **source code only**, and **no compiled binaries** or automation scripts. 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate Windows programming concepts such as:
- Keyboard hook installation

This is **not intended for malicious use**. I included it to document my progress in systems programming and security research as part of my learning journey.
